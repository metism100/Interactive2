Some cities have settled on new landfill locations, and in some cases invested in construction, only to discover both significant pub-lic opposition and problems in risk and impact assessment. Worldwide, landfills are a prism through which social scientists refract the politics and economics of consumption; intergovernmental, industry-government and labor relations; urban-rural divides; health; gender and waste  economies;  science-public  relations;  risk;  governance;  and  more (Maclaren and Thi Thu 2003). Landfills, these analyses suggest, tell us a great deal about ourselves, and our relations within communities, with the environment, and with global society. Waste,  landfill’s  necessary  precursor,  is  invested  with  a  diversity  of meanings, from lost work time, incomplete production and so on (Gille 2010). Yet despite its ubiquity, writes Wynne, “waste exist[s] in the twilight zone where no clear, ‘natural’ definition of [it] can be given, within wide margins of uncertainty and variation” (1987, 1). Like other contemporary environmental concerns, waste is associated with excess, and “coping with excess is what passes in late-modern society for individual freedom” (Bau-man 2001, 90). Modern capitalism defines waste entirely within economic terms as “simply resources out of place”, and concentrates on transform-ing it from the material detritus of industrialization into further economic potential. Waste management practices such as recycling further shift at-tention from “industry and production to households and consumption” (Hawkins 2006, 104; Kollikkathara, Feng, and Stern 2009).Waste  is  a  monument  to  all  that  we  once  wanted  and  now  do  not want, once valued and no longer value. Waste is an ironic testimony to a desire to forget. Landfills, in other words, make their appearance on and in the landscape as a material enactment of forgetting. As Hawkins ob-serves, the landfill is a:...world of soaring garbage, mountains and valleys, trucks and roads with its own distinct smell and soundscape; a place that organizes and frames things as waste. A place where “all the appetites and hanker-ings, the sodden second thoughts came runneling out, the things you ardently wanted and then did not.” The open landfill is a landscape in its own right, a “dump” where we confront the forceful presence of things just sinking into themselves, broken and decaying no longer bound by taxonomy or value. (2006, 71)
myra hird ‘WaSTE, LaNdfILLS, aNd aN ENVIRONMENTaL ETHIC’107I  am  interested  in  landfills  as  ubiquitous  places  of  forgetting,  the presumed end point to the garbage we diligently put on sidewalks to be taken  away  to  dumping  stations  and  then  to  the  countryside  and  other countries for burial out of sight, and mainly, out of mind. This forgetting is made possible through legislative decision, regulative decree, risk mod-els,  community  accession,  and  engineering  practice.  Landfills  are  a  site where “natural  processes  and  human  interactions  are  jumbled  together in complex and widely variable ways, making a badly structured and, in-deed, indeterminate behavioral-technical risk-generating system” (Wynne 1987, 1). Forgetting and environmental ethics, I will suggest, conjoin in these mundane sites that occupy ever-increasing geographies of space and time.Waste,  of  course,  doesn’t  really  go  away.  Waste  flows  (Gille  2006). Landfills are not only an archive to all our sated desire; they are “an ac-cumulation of the past that is very much alive in the present” (Van Wyck 2012). Metaphorically alive, to be sure, but much more than this. Waste, as Gregson and Crang remind us, “is a long ways from stuff that ‘just is’...rather it becomes” (2010, 1028). I want to attend to landfills as living natu-ral flows, where multitudes of bacteria collaborate with human debris and geological forces in creating entities, some of which we know need man-aging, and other entities—contaminants of emerging concern—that have yet to be identified, and whose management is therefore virtual. While this is a story of relational materiality – a gathering if you will – it is not one of co-enactment whereby humans ultimately (and triumphantly) manage or determine processes and outcomes. Landfills, I will argue, bring to the fore the asymmetric relationship between geo-bacterial liveliness and humans, suggesting an environmental ethics of vulnerability in which humans are vulnerable to living and nonliving earth processes (for an extended discus-sion see Hird 2012 and Clark and Hird, forthcoming). This vulnerability, in turn, calls for a heightened, not diminished, assumption of responsibil-ity.  Responsibility  extends  not  simply  from  curbside  garbage  to  landfill, but to the unknown and unanticipated; a future environmental ethics that depends  upon  remembering  what  we  have  forgotten. An  environmental ethics  concerned  not  only  with  past  and  present  damage  but  also  with future unknowable vulnerability to harm (van Wyck forthcoming).The science and engineering of landfills is all about making sure waste doesn’t leak. Leachate—putrescible and organic material transported by water—does just this: it leaks. Leachate moves between geological strata; 
2013108containment  and  disposal;  between  space  and  time. As  it  moves,  leach-ate disperses known, unknown, and unknowable entities. Some of these entities we know to be harmful, some will cause harm that will only be recognized as such at some undefined point in the future, and some will emerge as concerns in an unknown future.To bring this environmental ethics into view we must, says van Wyck, somehow figure out a way to “bring into memory, and thus bear witness to  events  which  we  don’t  want  to  remember,  nor...be  remembered  for” (forthcoming).  This  paper  explores  how  we  might  think  about  landfill-ing as an environmental ethical concern that brings buried and forgotten waste to the surface of our ethical landscape.Technoscience, Geoscience, and Radical asymmeTRy Eco-feminism forefronts analyses of the western ontological separa-tion  of  nature  from  culture.  These  explorations  span  a  wide  gamut  of materialities: baboons, microscopes, neutrinos, death, fire, and feet prove ill characterized as either nature or culture, but rather suggest a complex and  situated  entanglement  (Barad  2007).  Much  of  this  effort  stimulates re-engagement with the ontological relationship between humans, and the organic and inorganic. Within  science  and  technology  studies, Actor  Network Theory  pro-vides perhaps the most developed theory challenging the Kantian ontol-ogy  separating  humans  from  the  universe,  words  from  action,  and  an epistemology separating thought from being (for a detailed discussion see Hird  2011).  Latour’s “principle  of  generalized  symmetry”  requires  that analyses consider myriad nonhumans as well as human relations (1993, 103). These  nonhuman “missing  masses”  enroll  in  assemblages,  and  are defined by their strength of resistance to other entities (Latour 1992, 225). On occasion, these assemblages stabilize into networks, which afford op-portunities for action that evade any single entity’s own operations. As an analytic, assemblages and networks widen the allowable possibilities for relating, and replace humanity’s exclusive dominion with a “parliament of things” (Latour 1993, 142). As Puig de la Bellascasa points out, “humans are not the only ones caring for the Earth and its beings—we are in rela-tions of mutual care” (2010, 164).The focus on relational materialities resonates within feminist theory, as one of its signature goals remains to divest western philosophy of the 
myra hird ‘WaSTE, LaNdfILLS, aNd aN ENVIRONMENTaL ETHIC’109fallacy  of  humanity’s  intractable  autonomy.  Long  expert  in  disabusing (his)tory’s narration of man’s autonomy from women, home, nature, emo-tion, and irrationality, feminist science studies scholars attend to world-making through material technoscientific entanglements (Haraway 2007). A  significant  task  here  is  to  name  the  entities  that  compose  a  network; those differential forces that make up, stabilize, and move between strata, subtending further elements in new encounters.Conceptualizing  world-making  as  the  co-enactment  of  human  and nonhuman relations reveals instead the myriad relations upon which all life intimately depends. At the same time, however, we are challenged in our analyses to consider relations between nonhumans that do not some-how,  at  some  time,  also  involve  humans,  and  Latour’s  own  writing  has been criticized on this count (Harman 2009, Doing 2008, Clark 2010). By tending towards analyses that always involve humans, we forestall analy-ses of entities that exist prior to our encounter with them, and between nonhuman entities that do not involve or engage humans.This  point  brings  to  the  fore  a  critical  difference  between  geo-  and techno-sciences.  Technoscience  is,  by  definition,  concerned  with  knowl-edge-building through relations between humans and nonhumans in his-torical, political, economic, and social context. Humans, in other words, are central to technoscientific co-enactments: GM foods, stem cell research, artificial life, reproductive technologies, and global warming so-called fixes all involve encounters between humans and nonhumans that entrain new entities and politics via laboratory and field encounters. Technoscience, in other words, brings to the fore current practices and imagined futures in which humans make up the world through the manipulation and manage-ment of nonhuman entities (Clark 2010).Geoscience,  on  the  other  hand,  must  take  as  its  starting  point  the liveliness  of  inorganic  and  organic  processes  long  before  the  evolution of humans and other animals. Geoscience explores a cosmos where inor-ganic precedes organic, and billions year-old Earth processes establish life quickly,  proliferate,  differentiate,  and  engage  with  living  and  nonliving entities alike. Bacteria are central to these Earth processes, participating in the most enduring networks, establishing and sustaining the biosphere. They are, in an Actor Network Theory sense, the most robust of entities. Our last universal common ancestor, bacteria created all major forms of metabolism, multicellularity, nanotechnology, metallurgy, sensory and lo-
2013110comotive  apparatuses,  reproductive  strategies  and  community  organiza-tion, light detection, alcohol, gas and mineral conversion, hypersex, and death.  Far  from  autonomous  entities,  humans—like  all  other  animals—are a rag-tag assemblage of largely bacterial entities in constant flow, or as Ingold puts it, “it is not...that things are entangled in relations; rather every thing is itself an entanglement” (Ingold 2007, 35; Hird 2009). But further than this, bacteria remind us that most relational encounters on earth  have  nothing  to  do  with  humans;  nor  are  humans  even  aware  of most of these encounters and assemblages (Hird 2009). Geoscience  excels  in  recognizing  what  Clark  and  others  refer  to  as the “radical  asymmetry”  of  relations  between  humans  and  the  vast  ex-panse of nonhuman entities that created and continue to sustain the earth (2011,  48).  Geoscience  comes  to  the  fore  in  research  on  the  creation  of the Earth’s continents through bacterial proliferation and networking. For instance,  Schwarzmann  and  Volk  (1991)  have  shown  that  microbes  fa-cilitate rock weathering by as much as one thousand times. Lowman and Armstrong’s  research  on  plate  tectonics  suggests  that  while  the  earth’s major  concentric  layers—the  liquid  core,  the  convecting  mantle  and  the outer crust—were formed by the same kinds of processes found on other (silicate-rich) planets:the  broad  aspects  of  the  Earth’s  geology  as  it  is  now—continents, ocean basins, the oceans themselves, sea floor spreading and related processes—are the product of fundamentally biogenic processes, act-ing on a crustal dichotomy formed by several enormous impacts on the primordial Earth. The fundamental structure of the Earth, not just its exterior and outer layers, thus appears to have been dominated by water-dependent—and thus life-dependent—plate tectonic processes (2002, 279).Volk’s research on cycling ratios describes the biosphere as a “wasteland world”  in  which  one  organism’s  waste  is  another’s  treasure,  to  be  used as  food  or  other  resources  (oxygen,  for  instance,  is  plant  and  bacterial waste). Volk writes:[The  Earth  is]  one  big  wasteworld....  Regarding  the  atmosphere’s CO2, more than 99 percent of the entire reservoir has recently been ejected by a living respirer rather than a volcano. For nitrogen, more than  99  percent  has  been  discharged  from  living  denitrifiers  rather than volcanoes. And for methane and many other trace gases, more 
myra hird ‘WaSTE, LaNdfILLS, aNd aN ENVIRONMENTaL ETHIC’111than 99 percent has been expelled from living prokaryotes rather than volcanoes. The atmosphere is one giant waste dump (2004, 31).What techno- and geo-sciences share is a keen acknowledgement of the potential for lively encounters between entities to not proceed accord-ing to (human) design or plan. As Clark puts it, “there are pressing issues in which what is most alarming is life’s very exuberance; its unregenerate capacity to multiply, transform and mobilize itself, its proclivity to turn up in forms we didn’t anticipate, at sites we don’t want it, in numbers we can’t deal with” (2010, 27). So it is not so much that geo-science far better appreciates the way the geo-bio tends towards superabundance. What dif-ferentiates these approaches is their emphasis on co-enactment, or what forces  operate  in  these  proliferations,  new  life  forms,  and  potentialities. Within technoscience, the emphasis is on how humans interact with non-human entities, whether this be Pasteur and his human collaborators who enroll  bacteria  in  assemblages  through  bio-power  beyond  the  petri  dish such that “after 1864 airborne germs were there all along,” or the ways in which scientists and engineers are enrolling bacteria in bioremediation to treat forms of waste (Latour 1988, 173). The accent here is on those present and future processes in which humans may direct the geo-bio flow in  intentional  and  determinate  ways.  But  landfills,  I  suggest,  beg  much deeper consideration of geo-bio processes that are unsolvable by human regulatory policies and diversion practices.landfillinG and leachaTe Around the globe, up to 95 percent of all waste is dumped in landfills (Kim and Owens 2010). Due to the sheer quantity of waste being dumped, landfills may only be operational (in the sense of remaining open for con-tinued  dumping)  for  twenty  years.  Landfills  consume  a  vast  amount  of energy: all the energy used to sort, treat and recycle waste is insignificant compared to the energy (in the form of diesel fuel, electricity, petrol, bun-ker oil and natural gas) used to transport waste to landfills (Chong and Hermreck 2010).Landfills vary significantly in design, capacity, content, and after care. In  developed  countries,  for  instance,  landfills  are  lined  with  a  complex layering of rocks, sand, and geo-textile membranes and/or liners. In devel-oping  countries,  landfills  are  often  unlined  and  accept  unsorted  hazard-ous  and  nonhazardous  waste  alike.  In  Canada,  landfills  consist  of  any 
ETHICS & THE ENVIRONMENT, 18(1) 2013112number of waste cell layers. These cells are placed on top of each other to form waste columns; and landfills consist of any number of columns (Yildiz  and  Rowe  2004).  And  while  conceptual  models,  constructed  to test landfill quality, assume each layer is a completely mixed reactor with uniformly distributed waste, moisture, gases and bacteria—this is not the case, with cells containing decomposed material of varying degrees (ibid). Many factors need to be taken into account in terms of estimating landfill settlement: “type of waste, moisture content, compaction density, poros-ity,  compressibility,  biodegradation  rate  (level  of  nutrients  available  for biological activities, presence of enzymes, sludge addition, pH, tempera-ture), and mode of landfill operation” does not exhaust the list (Elabroudy et.al. 2008).Studying  landfills  is  in  a  geo-bio  sense  a  way  of  understanding  the social life of a wide diversity of things. As Parsons reminds us, an object spends  little  time  within  the  realm  of  human  production  and  consump-tion, which is but “one moment in the wider life of a thing” (2008, 392). Municipal landfills contain the expected—diapers, metals, plastics, Styro-foam, wood, liquids, refrigerators, pet shit and litter (as well as the dead pets themselves), batteries, food, chairs, fabrics, and so on—and the rather less expected, such as products of common industrial processes like coal fly ash, of which over 50 percent ends up landfilled (Chertow 2009). More than 308 million tons of plastics are consumed worldwide each year, and despite  heavy  campaigns  in  some  areas,  most  plastic  ends  up  landfilled (PlasticsEurope 2009). Over 97 percent of food waste is landfilled in the United States (Levis et al. 2010). Landfills also mix waste designated haz-ardous  with  that  defined  as  non-hazardous. While  hazardous  industrial waste is typically differentiated from municipal solid waste on the basis that it is generated from different sources, Wynne argues:“Hazardous”  waste  should  strictly  include  municipal,  household waste,  because  the  toxicity  of  many  domestic  wastes—batteries, cleaning  and  polishing  fluids,  cosmetics,  medicines,  etc.—is  higher than  that  of  some  industrial  wastes. The  toxicity  of  some  leachates from  municipal  landfills  is  at  least  as  high  as  that  from  controlled, “hazardous”  waste  landfills.  The  greatest  source  of  environmental cadmium  is  thought  to  be  from  batteries  thrown  out  in  domestic waste. Municipal waste incinerators are also known to emit dioxins with their aerial discharges, possibly to worse levels than toxic waste incinerators. Yet municipal waste is excluded, not for technical risk, but pragmatic reasons (1987, 46).
myra hird ‘WaSTE, LaNdfILLS, aNd aN ENVIRONMENTaL ETHIC’113This is what we put into the ground. Once there, these materials be-come  part  of  the  production  and  consumption  economy  of  bacteria.  In other words, these myriad heterogeneous materials leave the production economy  involving  humans  (bacteria  and  other  entities  are  already  an indelible part of this economy of course), and enter a nonhuman domain. Landfill bacteria are abundant and heterogeneous, their “variations may be cyclical, directional, stochastic, or chaotic” (Collins, Micheli, and Hartt 2000). The bacteria metabolizing objects in their early landfilled life are mainly  aerobic.  Acetogenic  biodegration  under  aerobic  conditions  pro-duces material that is highly acidic and toxic to surface water. Deeper in the  landfill,  mainly  anaerobic  bacteria  do  the  bulk  of  the  metabolizing work, producing leachate. Leachate is itself a heterogeneous mix of heavy metals, endocrine disrupting chemicals, phthalates, herbicides, pesticides, and various gases including methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen,  oxygen,  nitrogen,  and  hydrogen  sulphide.  Bear  in  mind  there are over seven million known chemicals, 80,000 of which are in commer-cial circulation, and with about 1000 new chemicals entering into com-mercial use each year (Wynne 1987, 48). Add to this the approximately 14,000 food additives and contaminants added to landfills when we put food  in  our  garbage.  Major  concerns  include  myriad  adverse  health  ef-fects for flora and fauna from soil and groundwater contamination, gas emissions, and so on. For instance, ninety percent of greenhouse gas emis-sions from the waste sector consist of methane emitted from landfills and wastewater. This accounts for about three percent of total greenhouse gas emissions (Chertow 2009).Factors  affecting  leachate  production  rate  and  composition  include thecharacteristics of the waste (initial composition, particle size, density and so on), the interaction between the percolating landfill moisture and the waste, the hydrology and climate of the site, the landfill de-sign  and  the  operational  variables,  microbial  processes  taking  place during the stabilization of the waste, and the stage of the landfill sta-bilization. Most of these factors change during the operational period of the landfill as the landfill is developed causing significant changes in leachate quality and quantity. (Yildiz and Rowe 2004, 78)Landfills  are  a  particularly  vigorous  assemblage:  bacteria  relentlessly metabolize  matter  into  leachate,  which  in  turn  percolates  into  soil  and groundwater,  where  it  moves  into  and  through  plants,  trees,  animals, </p></div>
