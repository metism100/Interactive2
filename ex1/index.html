        <h2>
          A Freshman at MLK Prep in Memphis, Tennessee, was getting bullied for weeks because he wore the same clothes to school every day.

          Two football players shut that down.

          Freshman Michael Todd said his first weeks of high school were a nightmare.

          On Monday, he was taken out of third period. He froze when football players Kristopher Graham and Antwan Garrett handed him a gift.

          Graham and Garrett surprised him with brand new clothes and new shoes.

          Todd told Fox 13, "It was the best day of my entire life."

        <p>
          focus on how you can use html typography intentionally!!!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          many of the same rules apply to type online as they do in other contexts,
          what does a readable paragraph look like, how can you establish hierarchy, or enforce a grid?
        </p>
        <p>
          one thing to be mindful of is how html and css comes with default styling that may not be what
          you want, the spacing between these paragraphs as an example.
